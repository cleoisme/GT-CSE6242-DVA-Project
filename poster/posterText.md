# Title

SPONGE and Beyond: Signed Weighted Graph Stock Clustering for Dynamic Market Forecasting

# Distribution

## 10% Motivation/Introduction:

- 5% What is the problem (no jargon)?

  As a popular trading strategy, statistical arbitrage has evolved over decades, and the addition of SPONG, a graph clustering algorithm for constructing portfolios, marks another major leap forward for this strategy. Nonetheless, the logic of this clustering algorithm and its portfolios combinations is obscure to many investors or even professionals, and with our project we hope to lower the barrier to investment management. Our project will be based on this clustering algorithm to outperform traditional statistical arbitrage and leverage D3.js to visualize the results as a network.

- 5% Why is it important and why should we care?

  Our project is very important in lowering the investment threshold and encouraging potential investors to enter the market. More investors mean more money in the flow, which will be of great benefit to the of the financial development.

## 20% Your approaches (algorithm and interactive visualization):
