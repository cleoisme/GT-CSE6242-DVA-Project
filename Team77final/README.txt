DESCRIPTION - This goal of this strategy is to build a cluster based stock investment strategy. The output is similar to sector based investment strategy where we would pick what sectors in the S&P 500 to over/under weight at each time step. Instead of using broad sector classification we partition the stock market in clusters based on a graph clustering algorithm called SPONG which is designed for signed weighted graphs. 
INSTALLATION - How to install and setup your code
The project data will need to be manually downloaded here, it should be available for users in the gatech domain: https://gtvault-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jmaniery3_gatech_edu/EVhXcEiZaGNCkuy7ETt5SoIBVLZvA8o7kcb8-Whsgbcrww?e=PPWvFr
EXECUTION - How to run a demo on your code
