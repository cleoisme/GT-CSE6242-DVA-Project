### 9 Heilmeier questions need to be answered by the proposal:

1. What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
2. How is it done today; what are the limits of current practice?
3. What's new in your approach? Why will it be successful?
4. Who cares?
5. If you're successful, what difference and impact will it make, and how do you measure them (e.g., via user studies, experiments, ground truth data, etc.)?
6. What are the risks and payoffs?
7. How much will it cost?
8. How long will it take?
9. What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success? How will progress be measured?
