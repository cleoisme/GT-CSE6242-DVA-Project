### Ideas:
1. Core CPI forecaster:
<br /> Instead of predicting the trend of cpi, I am thinking about something more like a model to assess the current macro-economic, showing the impact of different factors in the form of bubbles and giving homomorphic outcomes.
<br /> There are several statistics we can leverage:

    - non-farm payrolls
    - GDP
    - Interest rate
    - layoff numbers (?)
    - Bond price (?)
